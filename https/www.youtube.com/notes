BOTH ARE EXECUTED AT RUN TIME
INCASE OF CMD INSTRUCTION WE CAN OVERRIDE IT
INCASE OF ENTRYPOINT WE CANNOT OVERRIDE IT BUT WE CAN APPEND COMMNAD WE PASS AT RUN TIME
WE CAN USE ENTRYPOINT WITH COMBINATION OF CMD WHERE CMD BECOMES DEFAULT ARGUMENT FOR ENTRYPOINT EVEN THOSE DEFAULT ARGUMENTS CAN BE OVERRIDDEN AT RUNTIME BY PASSING OUR OWN 
ARGUMENTS (EX: docker run -it containerid 'hi hari')
